This folder contains my works from the HSE minor course ["Bioinformatics"](https://electives.hse.ru/minor_bioinformatics/).  
This course was organized by the [International Laboratory of Bioinformatics](https://cs.hse.ru/en/iai/bioinform/).

The first year of this course consisted of theory and familiarity with existing bioinformatics projects. The practical part was related to the usage of programs with GUI such as MEGA and PyMol.  
In contrast, the second year was dedicated to the workflow in terminal. The results of this analysis are presented in this folder.
