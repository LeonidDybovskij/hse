This folder contains some of my works from the HSE minor course ["Bioinformatics"](https://electives.hse.ru/minor_bioinformatics/).  
The course was organized by the [International Laboratory of Bioinformatics](https://cs.hse.ru/en/iai/bioinform/).

The first year consisted mostly from theory and acquaitance with the databases, projects, algorithms and programs existing. The practical part was related to the usage of programs with GUI such as MEGA or PyMol and therefore, there was no point in uploading works to the GitHub. This is why the first four repositories contain basic Python scripts and not bioinformatics projects.
The second year, however, was more about solving real tasks and is presented more abundantly here. There are 7 works from these two semesters as well as the final project, which consisted from individual and group parts.

There is also an original russian README.ru.md in every folder.
